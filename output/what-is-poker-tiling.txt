But that was not the end of it, and different kind of creative arrangements came up for players to play multiple tables comfortably.Common Tiling Setups for Online Poker:Basic Tiling or Common Grid: The mosaic or grid approach is the most common setup because it will allow you to keep every single table big enough and visible at all times. Since it is space comsuming, it is common for players to play with up to 4 monitors in their setup.Stack Tables: This means keeping all the different tables on top of each other, so you basically will only visualize the one on top. This could be your pick if you play on a laptop or have only 1 screen to distribute tables on.This approach can be benefitial, but it often requires Focus Management tools to get the most out of it.Mix of Stack & Tile: This mixed approach utilizes Stacks to keep tables that don't require action, but as soon as it's your turn, the table moves to a Grid where you place your focus.Getting Started with Poker Tiling SoftwareNow that you know what poker tiling is, its time to look into specific software solutions to asist you with your multi-tabling.JurojinPoker is a software that allows you to craft your own Customized Tiling solution for free.
