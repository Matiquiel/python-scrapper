It is easy to get distracted by outside influences when playing online poker.External factors can significantly affect your ability to maintain concentration, influencing decision-making and overall performance. Here's a breakdown of key external stimuli:Environmental Distractions: Creating a distraction-free gaming environment is paramount. Reduce the potential distractions and noises around you. Do not have the television, a movie or a football match playing in the background. Use a room that nobody else enters in and distracts you from playing.Technological Intrusions: Who has never checked his emails or social media accounts while playing online poker? Manage your devices wisely by silencing unnecessary notifications and utilizing apps that promote focus. Screen time management tools can prevent the intrusion of non-poker-related distractions, ensuring your undivided attention remains on the poker table.Emotions: Emotions wield influence at the poker table, from the thrill of victory to the sting of defeat.

Put Away Your PhoneIn the digital age, our smartphones can be both a blessing and a curse. When engaged in an absorbing poker session, the constant ping of notifications and the allure of social media can be potent distractors.If you are able to stay off your phone while you play poker, live or online, you should have a big advantage as people become more and more addicted to constantly checking/being on their phone while playing. Put the fucking phone away (I say this to myself as well). - Joe Ingram on TwitterTo safeguard your focus, establish a dedicated poker space and stow away your phone. Furthermore, turn your phone on ‚ÄòAirplane Mode‚Äô or simply turn it off while you are playing. The dopamine hits from seeing messages and notifications are just too attractive.Many of us grab for our phones as soon as we wake up, but you may begin to break the habit by beginning the day without it. It will be difficult at first, but give it some time and you won‚Äôt notice that strong desire anymore.2. Take NotesAmidst the fast-paced dynamics of online poker, the ability to retain valuable information about opponents is a game-changer. Equip yourself with a notebook or utilize the note-taking features of your poker tracker to jot down observations.By actively recording player tendencies and strategic insights, you not only sharpen your focus on the current session but also create a valuable reference for future encounters.üëâWe find that taking notes is great for discovering exploit patterns, write down the situations where your opponent is deviating from optimal play and come up with strategies to exploit those vulnerabilities.Constructive note-taking is a skill all on its own. Keep your notes as essential as possible as you will not have sufficient time to read loads of notes while you play and also come up with the right strategy against that player type.Also, notes should be useful for suggesting about a player‚Äôs tendencies or playing style. A note like ‚Äúbad regular‚Äù is not very useful compared to something like ‚Äúcalls too often pre-flop and plays aggressively post-flop‚Äù as in the latter case you could exploit this player type by making more light calls.3. Reduce the Number of Tables You Are PlayingPlayers often succumb to the temptation of managing an excessive number of tables simultaneously, thinking that they will increase their earnings per hour by playing more hands. Being able to play multiple tables at once is one of the significant benefits of online poker and also can help prevent boredom from setting in as you play.However, the allure of quantity can come at the expense of quality decision-making. In fact, while it is true that by increasing the number of tables you are playing, your total number of hands will also go up, your expected BB/100 will decrease after a certain threshold.Your playing style will become much more predictable and many of your decisions will be auto-pilot, as you won‚Äôt give them a lot of thought. Your opponents will soon understand your patterns and exploit you.If you find that you are getting overwhelmed by the huge amount of hands you are playing, consider cutting down the number of tables. As you progress along your poker journey, you will find that ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù number of tables that will prevent you from becoming bored while allowing you to observe the patterns and strategies of your opponents.üëâMulti Tabling is a skill that must be developed to increase your table count in a healthy way. Learn more about that here4. Take a BreakBecause online poker can be so captivating, it''s simple to lose track of time and play for extended periods of time. Even the strongest poker players will get tired and make bad and impulsive plays. Recognize the signs of mental fatigue and grant yourself moments of respite to recharge. Taking breaks can make the difference in the long run to improve your results.Consider using the Pomodoro technique, a time management method born in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to divide work at intervals, traditionally 25 minutes long, separated by brief breaks. Each interval is known as a "Pomodoro";, referring to the shape of some tomato-shaped kitchen timers.Consider taking a day off now and then as well. You don't have to play every day, and taking days off can make it much easier to focus when you return.5. Listen to MusicHarness the power of music as a tool to enhance your online poker focus. Selecting the right tunes can create a conducive atmosphere, helping you enter a state of flow and concentration.Music can keep you ‚Äúin the zone‚Äù and helps you to break the habit of checking your phone. Furthermore, it can boost your mood. Opt for instrumental or low-lyric tracks to minimize cognitive interference, allowing you to immerse yourself in strategic decision-making.Tune in to the ultimate Lofi Chill 1-hour Playlist for Poker Players produced by Jurojin Poker!

Being slouched puts you in a more relaxed mindset, which is not ideal for focusing on a poker game. Maintaining an upright and comfortable seating position not only promotes physical well-being but also positively influences mental alertness.Elevate your focus by incorporating this simple yet effective tip into your poker routine, ensuring that your posture becomes a silent ally in the pursuit of excellence at the poker tables.7. Talk About Ranges and Hands Out LoudTalk through your ranges, hand assessments, and strategic considerations out loud. This not only reinforces your understanding but also engages multiple senses, enhancing cognitive retention. By articulating your decisions, you create a mental dialogue that keeps your focus sharp and your strategic acumen finely tuned.In my poker career, I have frequently found that talking about ranges and hands out loud as I‚Äôm playing helps keep me engaged.
