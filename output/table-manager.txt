Typically a concept that players dive into once they attempt to multi-table - playing multiple tables simmultaneously - more than just 2 tables.The 3 Pillars of Table Management & Multi-Tabling are Tiling, Hotkeys & HUDs and in this guide we will make sure that you understand what you have to do to start leveling up your multi tabling skills. Let's start!👉Table Management Software is the key to increase the amount of tables you can handle and therefore the volume of hands you can play in your sessionWhat is a Table Manager Software for Poker?Table Management software primarily allows the poker player to organize their tables across one or multiple screens. It also often contains other Multi-Tabling functionalities such as:Tiling - Predefined Slots to organize the tables on screen.Hotkeys to perform all actions at Poker Tables.HUDs with relevant Stats, such as Pot Odds, SPR or Action LinesNow that you know what a table manager is and what you can get from it, we will continue by diving deeper on the Tiling portion, which will greatly benefit you in terms of session organization.Tiling - What are Layouts & Predefined Slots?A Layout is like a profile for your Table Tiling Flow, it is composed by Predefined Slots that shape how your tables will be displayed on screen. Both size and postion, as well as some behavioral changes that we will cover later in this guide.Jurojin Poker provides a variety of Slot Types as means to create your own Layout with your desired flow:Playing Slot: A Primary Static Slot. You can use these to organize tables on the predefined size & location.Observer Slot: A Secondary Static Slot. It serves as a second area to which you can assign for example tables from your secondary poker site.Lobby Slot: A Static Slot that can be used to define where should Jurojin locate the Poker Site's Lobby.Action Required Slot: A Dynamic Slot. When used, tables from your Playing/Ovserver Slots will move towards AR Slots when it's your turn to act. Table will move right back after you take action.In-Hand Slot: A Dynamic Slot. When used, tables from your Playing/Ovserver Slots will move towards In-Hand Slots when you VPIP - voluntarily put money on the pot - into a table. It will move back when you fold or after showdown.Any Slot can hold one or many tables. Generally speaking, players choose to create grids to be able to watch each table at all times, however laptop players are forced to other organization methods like Stacking.👉Layouts help you create a customized flow according to your needs. For example, if you have 3 screens you might preffer to go full static because you have room to create a grid. However if you're trying to handle more tables in a reduced space a combination with dynamic slots might be for you.Static Layouts - Begginer Table ManagementStatic Layouts are composed 100% of Playing/Observer Slots. Generally in a Tiled or Grid distribution.When defining the Slots on a Static Layout you can think about whether you want to distribute space evenly or give some slot more relevance. For Example:Cash players might go for an even mosaic / grid distribution like this:Where Tournament players might define a couple of bigger slots, to place Late Stage Tournament Tables or even Final Tables:Dynamic Layouts - Advanced Table ManagementAction Required Slots will tell Jurojin to move tables into their area when it's Hero's Turn. It is quite useful when playing around 4 ~ 6 tables. It is also something to consider if you do not have a lot of screen space to paly arround with. You can learn more about this dynamic here.In-Hand Slots allow you to create an area on which ONLY tables where you are still playing the hand will be placed.There are some options to configure that let you define what "In Hand" means for each site within its configuration;Until the tables reach that certain "In Hand" state, they will be sitting in your Static Slots (Playing/Observer) waiting to be moved.It is a very elegant way to improve your multi-tabling focus and should be strongly considered when playing more than five tables. Take in mind that you will need some Screen Space.Remember you can always add a new screen to your setup and Jurojin will work seamlessly with it!ConclusionAs a poker playing, delving into the online poker space and improving your multi-tabling skills opens up many challenges.
