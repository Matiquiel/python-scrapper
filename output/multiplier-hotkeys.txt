You can leave some sizes empty if you want, by deleting their value or simply by pressing the ESC key after clicking on the field.2Enable Multipliers for Preflop/PostflopThe times hotkeys only make sense when facing a bet/raise. However, you can tell Jurojin to prioritize the times betsize for preflop, postflop, or both using the toggle buttons on the view.
