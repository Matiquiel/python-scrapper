For instance, the "Check/Fold" action line involves a player checking their hand and subsequently folding when faced with an opponent's raise or bet. Another example is the "Call Down" action line, where a player consistently opts to check and call their opponent's bets on every street of the game.Another action line commonly seen in poker is the "Raise/Barrel" line. This strategy involves a player initiating the betting round with a raise and then continuing to place subsequent bets, known as barrels, on the following streets. By applying pressure with aggressive betting, the player aims to force their opponents to make tough decisions or fold their hands, ultimately aiming to win the pot without having to show their cards.How to Keep Track of Action?It is hard to keep track of how previous streets went down when you are multi-tabling.Who was the agressor? What betsize did he use?Luckily with Jurojin's Actions Line Overlay you can see everything at a glance.The importance of seeing the player actionsFor many this will be obvious, but for the more unexperienced players, being able to see what your oponent did from the beggining of the hand tells you a story, tells you the story the your oponent created, this story as you know might not always be true, but it's ncie to be able to have a whole picture of the story before making a decision in the river against an all in for example.Cheat Sheet of Visualized Action LinesAction NameExplanationF (Folds)The player decides to stop playing the current hand.L (Limps)The player is in preflop and only payed for the bigblind value (no one raised before, otherwise its a CALL!)C (Calls)The player Calls or Pays for the last bet or raise that was done.R (Raises)The player raises to a bigger amount than the previous betOR (Open Raises)The player Raises preflop before anyone else (previous amount before this raise was the big blind value)3B (Three Bets)On preflop, the player raises after someone has already raised preflop4B (Four Bets)On preflop, the player raises after someone has already 3 Betted5B (Five Bets)On preflop, the player raises after someone has already 4 Betted, at this point its usually All-In so you won't see this frequentlyAll-InPlayer puts all his chips into the hand, he is allowed to do this even if his amount of chips doesn't pay the current wager. If this happens the pot is divided in case this player wins (he can win only as much as he betted of course and multiplies on how many players go to showdown with him)CB (C-Bet or Continuation Bet)The player makes a new bet on a street having been the last aggresive player on the previous street.Use HUD Software to See Action Lines LiveKeeping track of Actions Line when multi tabling can be exhausting and doing so manually will cost you money down the road.
