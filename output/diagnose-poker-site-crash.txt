[HELP]Welcome to our troubleshooting guide for diagnosing and resolving crashes on your poker site. We understand how frustrating interruptions can be during your gaming experience, especially when stakes are high. It's important to note that each poker site is uniquely constructed using different technologies and frameworks. This diversity means that crashes can occur for a variety of reasons—ranging from server issues and software bugs to compatibility problems with your device.Our guide is here to help you navigate these challenges. We provide step-by-step instructions on how to locate and send us crash reports, enabling our technical team to analyze and address the specific issues you encounter. By working together, we can enhance your playing experience, ensuring smoother and more stable gameplay.Let's get started on pinpointing the cause of the crash and bring you back to the table!Locating Crash ReportsWhen your poker site crashes, it typically generates a crash report, which is crucial for diagnosing the problem. These reports are stored in a specific folder on your computer. Here's how to locate them:Open the File Explorer: Start by opening the File Explorer on your Windows computer. You can do this by pressing the Windows key + E on your keyboard or by clicking on the File Explorer icon on your taskbar.Navigate to the Crash Reports Folder: In the File Explorer address bar, type C://PokerSiteCrashes and press Enter. This will direct you to the main folder where crash reports are stored.Understand the Folder Structure: Inside the PokerSiteCrashes folder, you'll find several subfolders. Each subfolder is named after a specific poker site process. This organization helps in identifying which part of the poker site was running when the crash occurred.Subfolders by Casino - CheatSheetACRPoker: ACR Poker from WPN NetworkBlackChipPoker: BCP from WPN NetworkGameClient: Any Operator from ChicoPoker Network [BetOnline, TigerGaming, SportsBetting]poker: 888Pokerpokerclient: Any Operator from the IPoker NetworkPokerStars: Any PokerStars clientLobby: from PaiWangLuo Network [Bodog, ignition, Bovada]Winamax: From Winamax.fr/es Poker SiteWPT Global: from emerging WPT Global siteBy following these steps, you can successfully locate the crash reports for your poker site. The next section will guide you on how to identify and access the .dmp files, which contain the detailed information needed to diagnose the crash.Identifying and Accessing the .dmp FilesOnce you've located the crash reports in the appropriate folder, the next step is to identify and access the .dmp files, which are key to understanding what caused the crash. Here’s how to do this effectively:Identify the Correct .dmp File: Within each subfolder corresponding to a poker site process, look for files with a .dmp extension. These are the dump files that contain data captured at the time of the crash. To identify the most relevant file, check the date and time stamps on the files, which can help you correlate them with the crash incidents.Understanding .dmp Files: A .dmp file, or a dump file, typically contains a snapshot of the program's memory at the time of the crash. This snapshot includes information about what the program was doing when it crashed, the state of the program registers, and the program’s environment. This information is crucial for diagnosing the underlying issues.Size Considerations: Be aware that .dmp file,can be quite large, often several gigabytes in size. This is due to the comprehensive nature of the data stored, capturing extensive details about the application's state at the time of the crash.By identifying and accessing the correct .dmp files, you are one step closer to helping us diagnose and resolve the issues causing the poker site to crash. In the following section, we will guide you on how to upload these large files and send them to our support team for further analysis.Uploading and Sharing Crash ReportsAfter identifying the correct .dmp files, the next step is to upload these files so they can be shared with our support team for diagnosis. Due to their large size, these files require special handling during the upload process. Here’s how to efficiently and securely upload and share your crash reports:Compress the File: .dmp files are huge, and sub-optimal for upload/share, so first make a .zip/.rar with your favorite compressing app (e.g: WinRar)Choosing a File Sharing Service: For files as large as .dmp files, regular email attachments usually won't suffice due to size restrictions. Instead, use cloud services such as Google Drive or WeTransfer, which are equipped to handle large files. These platforms ensure that your data is transferred securely and swiftly.Uploading the File:Google Drive: Sign into your Google account and go to Google Drive. Click on ‘+ New’ then ‘File upload’. Navigate to your .dmp file, select it, and allow it to upload completely.WeTransfer: Visit the WeTransfer website. You can send files up to 2GB for free without creating an account. Click on ‘Add your files’, select your .dmp file, enter your email address and the email address of our support team, and then hit ‘Transfer’.Preparing the File for Sending: Once the file is uploaded, you’ll need to prepare to send it to our support team. If you are using Google Drive, right-click the file and choose ‘Get link’. Ensure the link sharing settings are set to ‘Anyone with the link can view’ to allow our team to access the file.Sending the File: Compose an email to our support team (support@jurojinpoker.com). Include a brief description of the issue you encountered, the time of the crash, and any other relevant details that might help diagnose the problem. Attach the link to the .dmp file in your email. Ensure you include any specific instructions or questions you have regarding the crash.Confirmation and Follow-Up: After sending the email, you might receive a confirmation from the support team acknowledging receipt of your crash report. Keep an eye on your email  & join our Discord Server for any further correspondence or requests for additional information.By following these steps, you can ensure that your crash reports are uploaded and shared securely and effectively, allowing our technical team to begin diagnosing the problem as soon as possible.Additional Support and ResourcesWe sincerely appreciate your trust in our team to assist with your technical issues.
