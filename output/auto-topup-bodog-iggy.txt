Turn the feature on in Jurojin of course!Setting up the valuesThe default values will be more than fine, having 100bb on the table is always a good idea, however if you wanna play it more on the hand tailored side, you can always define different values.Define when the blinds are restored back, and define to how many blinds you want to be restored, as simple as that!You can also tell Jurojin how many blinds to rebuy in case you get busted out (run out of chips) of the table!Triggers for Top-UpAutomatic Top-Up will trigger automatically in the following situations:Regular Cash Games: when Hero foldsRegular Cash Games: when Hand finishesZoom Cash Games: when Hand finishesZoom Cash Games: when using the Fold HotkeyüëâZoom games change very rapidly when folding a hand and thus Jurojin can only trigger a top-up BEFORE folding by using the Fold Hotkey. Manually clicking the fold button will not trigger automatic top-up.This feature will help you stay strong at the tables even when running cold, don't let a bad hand keep you as a weak exploitable player! Being short-stacked makes you a target.Good luck on the tables!Related ArticlesHaven't tried Jurojin yet?Download it now for free!Together we are moreBringing the poker community closer together¬øWant to connect with the Poker Community?
