It's not the same to have a AxS as button than as UTG (Under the gun aka. First to decide). Your preflop ranges (hands you will decide to play) will or at least should be drastically different under these different scenarios.As a general idea, you will have to play only strong hands in early positions, and when in late position you can go with a less tight range of cards to enter the hand as well as being more aggresive. The positional advantage is a huge deal in poker, the later you are to act, the more information you have to make decisions, as well as having a tactical advantage on your OOP (Out of position) oponent, specially for being aggresive.Next up, we will show you how to know Players Position on a quick glance with Jurojin's HUD.What are the Different Positions at the Poker Table ?The table is usually divided into Early Position (EP), Mid, and Late (LP) positions, being the latter the best position to be in. The closer you are to the button, the better your position at the poker table.Below you will find a small cheat sheet of the position names for six handed and nine handed (aka. full ring) which are the most common ring types, in other ring types can find find some repeated names but usually the same logic appliesPoker Player Positions Cheat SheatSix HandedPosition NamePosition GroupSB (Small Blind)(Super) Early PositionBB (Big Blind)Early PositionUTG (Under The Gun)/EPEarly PositionMP (Middle Position)Middle PositionCO (CutOff)Late PositionBTN (Button)Late PositionNine HandedPosition NamePosition GroupSB (Small Blind)(Super) Early PositionBB (Big Blind)Early PositionUTG (Under The Gun)/EPEarly PositionUTG2 (Under The Gun + 1)/EP2Early PositionMP (Middle Position)Middle PositionMP2 (Middle Position + 1)Middle PositionHJ (HighJack)Mid-Late PositionCO (CutOff)Late PositionBTN (Button)Late PositionSave HUDs Location with the HotkeyOnce you have dragged each seat overlay to the desired spot, you can use the save overlays location hotkey so next time you open a table with the same amount of seats the overlays will appear where you saved them!ðŸ‘‰Seat Overlays's location are stored per Ring-Type.
